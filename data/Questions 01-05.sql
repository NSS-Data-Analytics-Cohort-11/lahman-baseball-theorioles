-- 1. What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover? 
SELECT
	MIN(Year),
	MAX(YEAR),
	MAX(year) - MIN(Year) AS year_range
FROM homegames

--alternatively
SELECT MIN(yearid) AS first_year, MAX(yearid) AS last_year
FROM batting

-- 2. Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?
   
SELECT DISTINCT pe.fullname, pe.height, a.g_all AS games_played,t.name AS team_name  --a.team_id
FROM
	(SELECT playerid,namegiven|| ' ' || namelast AS fullname, height
	 FROM people
	 ORDER BY height
	 LIMIT 1) as pe
	
left JOIN appearances AS a

-- 3. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

WITH school_name AS (
		SELECT playerid, schoolname, namefirst, namelast
		FROM people
		INNER JOIN collegeplaying
		USING(playerid)
		INNER JOIN schools
		USING(schoolid)
		WHERE schoolname ILIKE '%Vander%'
		GROUP BY schoolname, namelast, namefirst, playerid
		ORDER BY schoolname)

SELECT people.namefirst, people.namelast, COALESCE(SUM(salaries.salary),0)::NUMERIC::MONEY AS total_salary
FROM people
LEFT JOIN salaries
USING(playerid)
INNER JOIN school_name
USING(playerid)
GROUP BY people.namefirst, people.namelast
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

--Notes: 
--I did a left join of people on salaries because I did not want to omit players whose salary data was missing. I did an inner join on school name CTE which is already filtered to only players who went to Vanderbilt. The highest paid player is David Price at $81 Million. However, there are 9 (out of 24) players with no salary data listed. 
--I also cast the salaries as Money for a cleaner look. I needed to first cast it as Numeric though becuase it was originally double precision and you cannot cast that as money directly. 
--The coalesce function replaces null values with 0's


-- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT
	CASE 
	WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'outfield'
		WHEN pos IN ('SS', '1B', '2B', '3B') THEN 'infield'
		WHEN pos IN ('P', 'C') THEN 'battery'
		END AS positions,
	SUM(PO) AS num_of_putouts
FROM fielding
WHERE yearid = '2016'
GROUP BY positions
ORDER BY num_of_putouts DESC;
   
-- 5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?

SELECT ROUND(1.0*SUM(teams.so)/SUM(teams.g),2)
		AS avg_strikeouts_per_game,
	ROUND(1.0*SUM(teams.hr)/SUM(teams.g),2) AS avg_homeruns_per_game,
	CONCAT(LEFT(CAST(teams.yearid AS VARCHAR), 3), '0') AS decade
FROM teams
WHERE teams.yearid >= 1920
GROUP BY CONCAT(LEFT(CAST(teams.yearid AS VARCHAR), 3), '0')
ORDER BY decade;
